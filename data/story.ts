/**
 * @file data/story.ts
 * @description This is the new central file for composing the story data. It imports raw data from
 * modularized files (characters, locations, etc.) and runs them through the transformation
 * layer. This architecture is significantly more maintainable and scalable than the previous
 * single-file approach.
 *
 * @architectural_note Future-Proofing for Build-Time Transformation
 * The `transformStoryData` function currently runs every time the application loads. For the ultimate
 * in performance, this entire file could be executed as part of a "build step" during development.
 * The output of `transformStoryData()` could be saved as a static `story.json` file. The application
 * would then simply fetch this pre-computed JSON, eliminating all runtime transformation costs and
 * enabling data validation before the app is even deployed. This modular structure is the necessary
 * first step to enable such an optimization in the future.
