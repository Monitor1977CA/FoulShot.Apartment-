Specifically, Respondent ARIEL COLE has demonstrated a pattern of increasingly erratic and unstable behavior, creating an environment that is detrimental to the well-being of the minor child.\\n\\nPetitioner will present evidence, including but not limited to, testimony from the child's nanny, text message records, and expert witness statements, to substantiate these claims. It is Petitioner's firm belief that it is in the best interest of the minor child to award sole legal and physical custody to Petitioner, with professionally supervised visitation for Respondent.\\n\\nWe pray the Court grant this motion."
